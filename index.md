## About Me

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 10px;">

    <p>
        Computational biologist and principal scientist focused on evolutionary processes, genotype-to-phenotype relationships, and functional impacts of sequence variation across animal species.

            I am currently leading multiple species de‑extinction projects at Colossal Biosciences, a company that sits at the intersection of synthetic biology and biodiversity conservation. We leverage genome engineering technology and multi‑omics datasets spanning extant and extinct species, as well as modern and historic populations, to preserve and restore biodiversity.

    <p>
        As a PhD candidate at the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School in the Karlsson Laboratory, I explored elements of the genome that shape variation in canine behavior. We partner with people and their dogs through the Darwin's Ark project (darwinsark.org) and the Dog Aging Project (dogagingproject.org).

    <p>
        Throughout my dissertation, I have gained a wide set of skills, including project leadership and biological data analysis for scientific initiatives with large-scale genomic datasets and digital phenotyping, development of Cloud-based computational workflows, and scientific writing and communication. 
    </p>

    <p>
        My past research spanned diverse topics, from resilience and genetic diversity in marine sea grasses to the effects of retrotransposon activation on neurodegeneration in the brain.

            Beyond research, I am also an illustrator eager for ways to combine my passions for science and art.
